<p class="content-content">Indiana University is committed to keeping its degrees affordable for in-state and out-of-state students. We encourage you to review the Office of the Bursar's listing of Tuition & Fees and Mandatory Fees. To determine approximate enrollment costs, use the Tuition Estimator by selecting the term, residency, level, program and number of hours to estimate the cost of tuition and associated fees. For international students, the Office of International Services outlines the tuition & Fees for international students.</p>
