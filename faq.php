<h1 class="content-title">Frequent Asked Questions</h1>
<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Is the GRE and/or TOEFL Required?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The GRE is required for the MS in Data Science degree program. Applicants who have completed another graduate degree, and/or have relevant work experience can apply to waive the GRE requirement. To apply for the waiver, please email dsadvise@indiana.edu. Include a copy of your resume/CV and scans of your transcripts for consideration.<br><br>
The TOEFL is required for admission and we look for minimum score 100. English proficiency is very important for all graduate programs. If you have not taken the TOEFL or IELTS yet, you can include a statement about your background and education with the English language as a supplemental material.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">What is the departmental code for reporting TOEFL and GRE?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">To report GRE and TOEFL you should only need the Institution Code of 1324 for Indiana University. If you would like to use a departmental code we recommend 0404 for Information Science.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">How do I report the GMAT?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The GMAT is not directly reported to the Data Science program. We recommend submitting your official scores to the IU Kelley School of Business, and sending a pdf of the score report to datasci@indiana.edu. This allows for the scores to be officially reported to the University, but also lets us process the test scores in a timely fashion.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">What test scores do I need to qualify for the program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">For the Data Science program, we take a very holistic approach to reviewing applications. As such we do not have specific minimum admissions requirements that students must meet to qualify for the program. While we do not have minimum requirements for the GRE, we do generally look for scores around Q-160, V-153, and AW-4.0.<br><br>
While we do look for a minimum TOEFL score of 100, a lesser score will not automatically disqualify you from admission. Each aspect of your profile will be evaluated by the Admissions Committee before a final decision is rendered. Additionally due to student privacy rules we will not release specific information or profiles about the GPA or test scores of an incoming class or current class.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">What sort of background is required for the program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">There is no specific background or undergraduate degree required for admission to the program. Many of the classes do require familiarity with both statistics and computer programming languages. For more specific requirements about programming language requirements, please contact the Data Science program directors at dsadvise@indiana.edu.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">What is the total cost of the program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The total cost of the program will vary depending on which program you apply and are admitted for.
<br><br>For the online program, the anticipated total cost for 30 credit hours should be approximately $12,500. This is made possible by a Data Science Scholars Fellowship which is meant to provide "in-state level" costs to all students. The only mandatory fees associated with the Online program is the Distance Education Fee applied by Indiana University. For each online course, a fee of $90.00 is applied.
<br><br>The residential program will largely depend on residency classification and the current tuition rates. To check the current tuition rates please visit the IU Office of The Bursar’s website here: https://bursar.indiana.edu/tuition-fees/fees-semester.html. Additionally there are fees associated with each individual class. To estimate the total tuition for a given semester please visit the Bursar’s website here: https://bursar.indiana.edu/tuition-fees/index.html. Because tuition and cost of living vary greatly from year to year, we do not estimate the total cost of the residential program.
<br><br>In the Hybrid program, the first 12 hours will be at the online rate and bring the anticipated total costs to around $4,800. The final 18 hours will be at the residential rate which have been addressed above.
<br><br>If you are an international student and need cost information for visa documentation, please contact the IU Office of International Services at ois@iu.edu or by phone at 812-855-9086.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">What is the total duration of the program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">While there is no minimum duration requirement for the Data Science program, we highly recommend that full-time students complete the program in 1.5 to 2 years. Students do have a maximum of 5 years to complete the program.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Can I transfer some courses to count towards the program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">As a standard practice, we will allow up to 6 credit hours to transfer from another program or school. These credits cannot have counted towards another program where you received a degree or certification.
<br><br>To transfer the courses, please send an email with course descriptions to the Data Science Program Directors at dsadvise@indiana.edu requesting courses to count towards the degree. If approved by the program directors it is then the student’s responsibility to provide an official copy of the transcript to the Data Science Office. Our Office will then request the credits transfer as undistributed graduate credit on your IU transcript.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Is the program completely online? Or will I have to come to Bloomington at some point?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The program is completely online, and there is no requirement that online students come to Bloomington during their studies.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Does the program offer scholarships or assistantships?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The Data Science program does offer the ability to be a temporary hourly instructor or research assistant after the first semester of coursework on the Bloomington campus. More information will be provided on this opportunities to admitted students.
<br><br>To enquire about prospective internships for the future, please contact the Data Science program directors at dsadvise@indiana.edu.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Is the program STEM eligible or accredited?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">For purposes of OPT the Data Science program is STEM eligible. As regulations do sometimes change, we always recommend students discuss the OPT application with an advisor at the IU Office of International Services.
<br><br>At this time we do not know if any particular body that accredits programs for Data Science. Indiana University is a not-for-profit university that is regionally accredited by North Central Associate of The Higher Learning Commission.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Do I need to submit official transcripts?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">Yes - we do require official transcripts to enroll in the program. If you would like to submit unofficial transcripts for your application, we can use scans of transcripts for purposes of the application but official transcripts must be submitted to the Data Science Program by the time of enrollment.  
<br><br>Transcripts should be mailed to:<br>
    Data Science Admissions<br>
    School of Informatics and Computing<br>
    Indiana University<br>
    711 N Park<br>
    Bloomington, IN  47408
<br><br>
For international students please check the IU Office of International Services website here: http://ois.indiana.edu/admissions/apply/graduate/equivalent.shtml to review what documents are required for admission.
</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Do we accept WES evaluation as official?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">We do not accept WES or another other third-part evaluation service as official transcripts. If an applicant submits a WES evaluation, we will view those documents as unofficial scans, and the applicant will be required to provide official transcripts should they enroll in the Data Science program.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">How long does the review process take?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The length of time for the review process will vary depending on time of year and how busy the faculty members are at the given moment. Once an application is complete and placed in review, we strive to complete the review process in about 2 weeks. Depending on the time of year the review process could take as long as 8 weeks. Please feel free to contact datasci@indiana.edu or 812-856-5359 for an update.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Do we offer conditional admission?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">We do not offer conditional admission to any student. If a student would like to apply for the IU English Intensive program, we would be happy to consider the application once the program is complete. Completion of the IEP program does not guarantee the student will be admitted to the Data Science program.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Do we have a dual degree program?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">At this time we do not have any dual degree programs with other units on campus. We do have courses approved to count towards the degree in information science, informatics, computer science, and statistics.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Do we have a PhD degree?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">We currently do not have an approved PhD in Data Science. We are in the process of submitting the proposal for the degree, but the final approval may not come for a couple of years.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Are there any Core classes that are required?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The MS in Data Science is designed to be very flexible, and allow for customization by the students to complete the courses of the most interest.  The requirements for the degree are available on our website here: http://www.soic.indiana.edu/graduate/degrees/data-science/ms-data-science/ms-requirements.html
<br><br>For more information on specializations, please contact our Program Directors at dsadvise@indiana.edu. They would be happy to discuss your questions in greater detail via Skype, email, or phone call.
</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Are there any foundation classes?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">At this time, we do not have any specific foundational courses such as basics of programming. The statistics department does offer an introduction to statistics, and the program directors are exploring more options for fundamental courses. If you would like more information about course development please contact the Data Science program directors at dsadvise@indiana.edu.</p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Is Financial Documentation required for the application?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The financial documentation is not part of your application. The Office of International Services strongly recommends that applicants submit their financial documentation using iStart once they have submitted an application. You should be receiving an email from the Office of International Services with instructions on how to set-up your iStart account. If you have not received an email from the Office of International Services, email newtoiu@indiana.edu.  In that email be sure to include your first name, last name, and e-app number.  After you set up your iStart account, you will be able to submit the Financial Documentation e-form in iStart.
<br><br>By having your financial documentation uploaded into your iStart account, it will expedite the processing of immigration documents in the event you are admitted to our program and accept the offer of admission. If you have questions about the financial documentation, email the Office of International Admissions at newtoiu@indiana.edu. Federal regulations require every admitted international student to demonstrate that the student has current resources available to support himself/herself during their first year of study in the United States. Immigration documents will not be issued to any admitted student until the required financial documentation is received by the Office of International Services. For a detailed listing of current estimated expenses for study at IU, please visit http://ois.iu.edu/admissions/tuition-fees/graduate-expenses.shtml We look forward to receiving your supporting materials. </p>

<h1 class="content-heading content-expand js-content-expand">Any TEPAIC tips?</h1>
<p class="content-content hide">The TEPAIC is a Test of English Proficiency for International Associate Instructor Candidates. A passing TEPAIC score is required for all non-native English speakers in order to be considered for an AI position in the event a position becomes available.
Your Academic Advisor and/or Department must give permission for a student to take the TEPAIC. Once your name has been submitted to the TEPAIC Department, you will receive information on what to do next.
There will be two English evaluators conducting the TEPAIC. It will be a casual conversation. The English evaluators will be assessing (1) how clearly and fluently you speak; (2) how effective are your interactional communication skills; and (3) how effectively you explain concepts. I know it is hard, but try not to be nervous. Engage in the conversation as you would when talking with friends.</p>
