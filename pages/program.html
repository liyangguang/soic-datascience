<p class="content-content">Data science has been called “the sexiest job of the 21st Century.” With a projected shortage of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills, as well as 1.5 million managers and analysts with the know-how to use the analysis of big data to make effective decisions, data science is a rapidly growing, high-paying field.</p>
<p class="content-content">Enormous amounts of data are generated every day in a range of areas—social media, search engines, insurance companies, healthcare organizations, hospitals, defense, retail, and many others. Those trained to analyze, visualize, and report these data will add great value across a range of sectors.</p>
